# getadrink.py
Essentially a python Hello, World. Now with 100% less copyright infringement.
\
\
Contains the following rudimentary concepts:
\
\
Time module
\
User-defined string variables
\
User-defined integer variables
\
If Else statements
\
Case-insensitive input
\
Defined functions
# Goals:
1. ✅️ Learn to compress the "time.sleep(1) print("Glug...") function so I can re-use it without cluttering up the code
   - Resolved this by using a defined function called glug()

2. Allow for variances of yes such as "yeah", "okay", etc. Maybe implement an "I didn't hear you, was that a yes?" string or something similar. Same goes for negative responses.

3. ✅️ Continue offering drinks and keep track of how many drinks the user has had. Inform them before script exits.
   - Implemented this feature in getadrinkexpanded.py by creating the drink_count variables and adding 1 value per complete loop. Doubled the value at the end of the script to simulate myself and the user having drinks together.
