# getadrink.py
Essentially a python Hello, World. Contains the following rudimentary concepts:
\
\
Time module
\
User-defined string variables
\
User-defined integer variables
\
If Else statements
\
Ability to understand non-case sensitive input
\
# Goals:
Learn to compress the "time.sleep(1) print("Glug...") so I can re-use it without cluttering up the code
